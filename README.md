# first_app

This is the first app i've developed while learning flutter.
Since this was just a learning experience,only a few modules are integrated.
<br/>The app is currently integrated with 3 modules:
1. A **Movies section** that lists a bunch of movies with their details.
2. A **Tip Calculator** that can be used by a group of people to calulate their individual share in a bill with gratuity.
3. A **Social Board** that implements the features of firebase along with firestore database. Using the social board, users can post their thoughts on a common feed.
Here are a few images of the app:
